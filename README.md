# CVE-HUNTER POC

*Disclaimer - This tool is a compliation of [webanalyze](https://github.com/rverton/webanalyze), [vdb (AppThreat)](https://github.com/AppThreat/vulnerability-db), and [nuclei by projectdiscovery](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) all the hard work and credit goes to the creators of those tools.... NOT ME. Lastly, we are not resposible for what you do with this tool, that is on you*


## Installation

1. Spin up a Linux Container (We just used a headless Kali Docker image to keep it simple)

2. Update Repositories

   	```sudo apt update```

3. Install webanalyze

	```go install github.com/rverton/webanalyze/cmd/webanalyze@latest```

	```cp /<full path to>/go/bin/webanalyze /usr/bin```

	```webanalyze -update```


4. Install AppThreat VDB

	```pip install appthreat-vulnerability-db```

	```vdb --sync```


5. Install Nuclei

	```apt install nuclei```


6. Download the cve-hunter.sh script to your home directory...yeah it only works from there at the moment due to nuclei feel free to fix it.

	```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gromhacks/cve-hunter.sh/main/cve-hunter.sh```

	```chmod +x cve-hunter.sh```


## Usage

	./cve-hunter.sh urls.txt


## How was cve-hunter born?

"cve-hunter" was born out of the desire to streamline and filter CVE penetration testing. All to often, cyber security professionals and bug bounty hunters are faced with new CVEs. There are many tools to detect this sort of thing from an internal perspective, but very few are external facing, easily run from the CLI, and most importantly...free and open sourced!

Conceptually cve-hunter does the following via a simple bash script that utilizes a 'url.txt' list:

1. Identifies host operating systems, programming language versions(s), and web server version(s) with webanalyze. 
2. It then in a very ugly manner parses this information and passes it to AppThreat VDB.
3. AppThreat VDB updates and runs locally to search for related CVEs for the various programming and webserver versions.
4. cve-hunter then parses that information and passes it off to nuclei to conduct a scan.


## What cve-hunter is not?

* "cve-hunter" is not a supported tool.... I mean come on this was thrown together as a beta proof of concept/ placeholder. I'm sure the folks at projectdiscovery or just about anyone else can do a much better job. PLEASE DO!!!
* "cve-hunter" is not something you can work into you bug bounty recon...yet
* "cve-hunter" is not something you should fire off against things that you do not own or have permission to test!!
* "cve-hunter" is not pretty, it was/is only functional for the testing what it was tuned against.


## Things that need to be added

* Cookie / Authenticated Support
* A switch to just run agains one host
* Switch(s) to only conduct host scanning, cve detection, and or nuclei testing
* Httpx Integration
* WhatWeb Integration
* Wappaylzer API Support
* Searchsploit Integration
* ReconFTW Integration
* Axiom Integration
* Better error handling...it only works if it detects something...otherwise its a mess.
